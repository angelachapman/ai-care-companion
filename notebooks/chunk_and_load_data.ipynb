Samis, “Home Alone: Family Caregivers Providing Complex Chronic Care,” AARP Public Policy Institute & United Hospital Fund, 2012. 2 Considering all of the responsibilities that dementia caregivers often shoulder, it is of no surprise that the Burden of Care Index2 shows them as one of the more burdened groups of caregivers. Nearly half of dementia caregivers are in a high-burden situation. Dementia caregivers are not the most-burdened group—for example, cancer caregivers are more likely to be in high-burden care relationships (62 percent).3 However, whereas cancer caregiver relationships are short and episodic, dementia caregiver relationships tend to be longer: nearly seven in ten (69 percent) dementia caregivers have provided care for more than a year, and three in ten have provided care for more than five years. This high burden of care over a longer period can take a significant mental and physical toll on dementia caregivers. Nearly half of dementia caregivers say providing care is emotionally stressful, and three in ten say that providing care often involves physical strain. Ultimately, this physical and emotional stress appears to have a negative impact on the health of many dementia caregivers. About four in ten (42 percent) say their health is “excellent” or “very good”—statistically significantly lower than the share among non-dementia caregivers (50 percent). Alarmingly, dementia caregivers are nearly twice as likely to say that their health has gotten worse as a result of their caregiving responsibilities. More than one in three dementia caregivers says their health has declined (35 percent), versus just one in five non-dementia caregivers. Many dementia caregivers report that they receive help. Dementia caregivers, more than non-dementia caregivers, are often one part of a larger care team, and they receive more paid and unpaid assistance than non-dementia caregivers. Four in ten dementia caregivers are the sole unpaid caregiver for their loved one. Nearly half of dementia caregivers say their loved one has received help from aides, housekeepers, or other paid help (45 percent), including 43 percent of sole unpaid dementia caregivers. More than one in four has used a respite service (27 percent). However, not all dementia caregivers can find resources when they need them: 28 percent say they find it difficult to get affordable services in their loved one’s community. Six in ten dementia caregivers were employed in the last year while they provided care to their loved one. Employed dementia caregivers work an average of 34.9 hours per week while caregiving, and more than half (57 percent) work full time. Seven in ten employed dementia caregivers (70 percent) say their supervisor was aware of their caregiving situation. Nonetheless, many employed caregivers struggle to balance their job and their caregiving responsibilities. Two in three employed dementia caregivers report that their caregiving responsibilities affected their work in some way (statistically significantly higher than the 59 percent of non-dementia caregivers). 2 “Burden of Care” is an index that is based on the number of hours of care provided by the caregiver, the number of ADLs performed, and the number of IADLs performed. Points are assigned for each of them; ultimately, these points are consolidated into three burden categories: low (values 1–2), medium (3), and high (values 4–5).

Further, dementia caregivers more often experience emotional stress and physical strain than do non-dementia caregivers—a situation that contributes to the disproportionately worsening health among dementia caregivers. Prior research has documented the ways caregiving can affect caregivers’ health and well-being. Caregiving has been associated with higher levels depression and anxiety, compromised immune function, and increased mortality.17 These negative health impacts mean that caregiving is a crucially important public health issue—caregivers’ health suffers under the pressure of caregiving responsibilities, and such decline in health compromises the caregiver’s ability to provide care. This problem is particularly pressing for dementia caregivers, as health impacts are worse and loved ones rely on these caregivers for more daily assistance. Therefore, it is critical to improve the resources and help available to dementia caregivers so that they can easily and adequately care for their loved ones and for themselves. 17 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Kimberly-Clark Corporation, “Assuring Healthy Caregivers, A Public Health Approach to Translating Research into Practice: The RE-AIM Framework,” Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Neenah, WI, 2008.' metadata={'url': 'https://www.caregiving.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dementia-Caregiving-in-the-US_February-2017.pdf', 'chunk_id': 47, '_id': '54fdf9f9-aede-4958-aef3-abaf7636c466', '_collection_name': 'DementiaCare_Fixed'}\n",

Figure 11: Difficulty of Performing Medical/Nursing Tasks N4: How difficult is/was it for you to do the medical/nursing tasks that are/were required to help your [relation]? Dementia caregivers’ lack of prior preparation and difficulty doing these complex medical/nursing tasks suggest a need for additional training and support. Some ways that dementia caregivers would prefer to learn medical/nursing tasks are to work in person with a qualified teacher or other professional. Most say they would like to have a qualified person show them how to do medical/nursing tasks (67 percent) or do it themselves while a qualified person watches (60 percent). Fewer say they would want videos on demand or written instructions.

      "1 Executive Summary Key Findings This report analyzes the experiences of providing unpaid care in the United States to a relative or friend diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or other mental confusion, with the goals of both understanding the experiences of people caring for someone with dementia and identifying approaches to enhance and support this unique caregiving experience. We draw our analyses from the nationally representative study Caregiving in the U.S. 2015 and examine caregivers who indicate that their care recipient had Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or some other type of mental confusion as either a primary or a secondary reason for providing care. This paper describes the experiences of these caregivers (n=372, referred to hereafter as dementia caregivers) and compares their experiences with those of caregivers who provided care to someone without dementia (n=963, referred to hereafter as non-dementia caregivers). In addition, we analyze subgroups of caregivers within dementia caregivers to better understand variations in experiences of dementia caregiving. These dementia caregivers have diverse backgrounds. A majority of dementia caregivers are women (58 percent). On average, they are 54 years old—about six years older than non-dementia caregivers. Their care recipient—that is, the person with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia—is most often a relative, and 77.2 years old, on average, which is significantly older than other care recipients who are managing other conditions or diseases. These care recipients are less likely to live in their own home (40 percent) and more likely to live in some sort of facility (16 percent live in nursing/long-term care or assisted living). Dementia caregivers shoulder more caregiving responsibilities than do other caregivers: they help with a wider variety of activities and spend more hours per week providing care. On average, dementia caregivers provide care for 28 hours per week. They assist in significantly more tasks than do other caregivers, including more Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and more Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADLs). In addition, most dementia caregivers play an important role in guiding their loved one through the healthcare system and ensuring that they receive needed treatments. Moreover, two out of three dementia caregivers (67 percent) say they themselves perform medical/nursing tasks1 for their care recipient, and more than half of all dementia caregivers do these medical/nursing tasks with no prior training or preparation. 1 Medical/nursing tasks include skilled activities such as administering injections, tube feedings, catheter and colostomy care, and many other complex medical responsibilities. For additional work on these tasks, see: S.C.' metadata={'url': 'https://www.caregiving.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dementia-Caregiving-in-the-US_February-2017.pdf', 'chunk_id': 2, '_id': '560030ab-836d-48a8-b900-4d729d2986c6', '_collection_name': 'DementiaCare_Semantic'}\n",
      "page_content='21 Figure 18: Impact of Caregiving on Caregiver Health D2: How would you say taking care of your [relation] has affected your health? The negative health impacts from dementia caregiving do not seem to be a result of caregiver age.16 Rather, whether a caregiver’s health declines as a result of caregiving appears to correlate strongly with rates of emotional stress and physical strain (see Figures 19 and 20). As the emotional stress level of dementia caregivers increases, so too do reports of worsening health. In fact, once emotional stress hits a middle level (3 out of 5), dementia caregivers report negative health impacts nearly twice as often as non-dementia caregivers do. Among dementia caregivers with the highest emotional stress (5 out of 5), three out of four say caregiving has made their health worse. Figure 19: Negative Health Impacts of Caregiving by Emotional Stress Percent reporting worse health as a result of caregiving 16 The rate of caregivers reporting they have worse health as a result of caregiving is similar among those ages 45–54 (38 percent), 55–64 (43 percent), and 65–74 (38 percent).

Popham, “Cancer Caregiving in the U.S.—An Intense, Episodic, and Challenging Care Experience,” National Alliance for Caregiving, National Cancer Institute, and Cancer Support Community, 2016. 3 Dementia caregivers want greater support from healthcare professionals. Many dementia caregivers want more support from healthcare providers in caring for their loved one as well as themselves. Less than half of dementia caregivers (44 percent) report having a doctor, nurse, or social worker ever ask them what they need to care for their loved one. Moreover, roughly a quarter (24 percent) of dementia caregivers have ever been asked about their own self-care needs by a doctor, nurse, or social worker. About the same number (26 percent) report wanting these kinds of self-care conversations, but say they have never had them. This suggests that the need or desire for self-care conversations between healthcare professionals and dementia caregivers is greater than the actual occurrence of these conversations. Many want more information on specific aspects of providing care. More than half (52 percent) of dementia caregivers say they need more help and information about managing their own emotional and physical stress. In addition to managing stress, 39 percent say they need help and information about keeping their loved one safe at home. Dementia caregivers are more than four times more likely to say they need help managing their loved one’s challenging behavior and are nearly three times more likely to want help managing incontinence. Many dementia caregivers want to be kept more involved in their loved one’s medical care. More than half would find it helpful to require health providers to include their name on their care recipient’s chart (56 percent). One out of four (27 percent) has never made use of respite care but wants to do so. This indicates that there is a need among some dementia caregivers for easily accessible respite services. In summary, dementia caregivers are in intensive, demanding care situations. While they do have more support from other unpaid caregivers, paid help, and the healthcare system than do non-dementia caregivers, many remain in need of greater support and resources. Policy Implications With unique challenges facing dementia caregivers, we recommend the following: Establish a National Strategy that Recognizes and Supports Family Caregivers Family caregivers are the backbone of the long-term care system, especially for those with dementia. They take on challenges that affect their health, emotional wellbeing, and financial security. All too often, family caregivers are not recognized and included in appropriate health and social service programs, and ultimately not receiving the care and support they need. Dementia caregivers shoulder more caregiving responsibility than other caregivers do: they help with a wider variety of activities and spend more hours per week providing care. The recently released Families Caring for an Aging America, conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, includes a recommendation that the new Administration develop and execute a National Family Caregiver Strategy. 4 Although the National Academies’ recommendation was focused only on caregivers of older adults, we believe that the National Family Caregiver Strategy should address the needs of all caregivers across the lifespan. Provide Dementia Caregivers with a Comprehensive Needs Assessment Less than half of dementia caregivers (44 percent) report having a doctor, nurse, or social worker ever ask them what they need to care for their loved one. Moreover, only one-quarter (24%) of dementia caregivers have ever been asked what assistance they need for self-care. Similar to a patient, dementia caregivers require a comprehensive assessment prior to the development of the care plans. A caregiver assessment will serve as an entry point to understanding what a care plan will need to include to ensure patient and family centered goals are met. Protect the Financial Security of Dementia Caregivers The inordinate amount of time they spend providing care—28 hours per week on average—leaves dementia caregivers at a disadvantage as they attempt to maintain employment. To most effectively balance their job and caregiving responsibilities, caregivers need employers to provide paid and flexible family and medical leave options. This must include at least partial income during the time they spend away from work due to caregiving obligations. Previously, legislation was introduced in Congress that would provide workers with up to 12 weeks of partial income when they take time away from work to care for themselves or a loved one. It is essential to protect the financial security of dementia caregivers by providing them with options for paid-leave. Over half (57 percent) of dementia caregivers work part-time. On average, they work only 34.9 hours per week. Not only does this loss of income have a negative impact on their take-home pay, it also hinders their ability to adequately save for retirement. Dementia caregivers need a refundable tax-credit to help reduce the financial burden of providing care. Additionally, these caregivers need social security earnings credits to ensure that their retirement security is not jeopardized due to their caregiving role. Expand Dementia Caregiver Access to Long-Term Supports and Services Dementia caregivers are often managing multiple health and behavioral conditions. In addition, most dementia caregivers play an important role in guiding their loved one through the healthcare system and ensuring that they receive the treatments they need. Health care providers need to be incentivized to offer advance care planning assistance for those diagnosed with dementia and their caregiver(s). Advance care planning benefits help caregivers make informed decisions while managing the complexity of care and may help to prevent care recipients from prematurely entering into long-term care programs. Over half (52 percent) of dementia caregivers say they need more help and information about managing their own emotional and physical stress. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services should test support models for caregivers, recognizing that support\n",
      "5 for caregivers will help care recipients remain in the home longer, ultimately reducing Medicare and Medicaid program costs. Support models should include options for individual and family counseling, caregiver support groups, and a call-in phone line offering immediate assistance for dementia caregivers. One out of four (27 percent) dementia caregivers has never made use of respite care, but wants to do so. This indicates that there is a need among dementia caregivers for easily accessible support services. Strengthening federal programs that help sustain family caregivers can bolster our Long-Term Supports and Services system. The federal government provides high-impact support for family caregivers through the National Family Caregiver Support Program, the Department of Veterans Affairs’ VA Caregiver Support Program, and the Lifespan Respite Program. These programs include relief, education, training, and financial support to family caregivers. It is vital that efforts are made to expand these programs. Include Dementia Caregivers as Vital Members of the Health Care Team Dementia caregivers want to be involved in their loved one’s medical care. Health care policy should explicitly and clearly include family caregivers in all aspects of care planning for those with dementia. Family caregivers are an essential component of the patient and family-centered care model. Meanwhile, over half of all dementia caregivers perform medical/nursing tasks with no prior training or preparation. Family caregivers must be recognized and included as legitimate members of health care intervention teams. The Alliance applauds state efforts through the CARE Act to achieve these goals. 6 Full Report Introduction This report reviews the experiences of providing unpaid care4 in the United States to a relative or friend diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. Our analyses come from the study Caregiving in the U.S. 2015 and examine caregivers who indicated that one of the reasons why this family member or friend needed care was due to Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or other mental confusion.5 These caregivers are hereafter referred to as dementia caregivers. This paper describes the experiences of these dementia caregivers and compares them with those of caregivers who provide care to an adult family member or friend who does not have dementia (hereafter referred to as non-dementia caregivers). In select places, this paper also summarizes differences within the experiences of dementia caregivers by key subgroups. Methodology Caregiving in the U.S. 2015 is a nationally representative study of adults, ages 18 and older, conducted in late 2014 using GfK’s probability-based online KnowledgePanel®. Caregiving in the U.S. 2015 aimed to achieve two goals for the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP Public Policy Institute. First: estimate the prevalence of caregiving for someone of any age as a share of both the U.S. population and U.S. households. Second: describe the characteristics, roles, and needs among caregivers who provide care to an adult age 18 or older.6 In order to qualify for the study, respondents must have self-identified as an unpaid caregiver of an adult either currently or at some point in the 12 months prior to the survey. Self-identified caregivers also had to report providing help with at least one Activity of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL), or medical/nursing task. Surveys were conducted between September 18 and November 5, 2014, and averaged 24 minutes to complete (23.8 minutes online; 24.7 minutes on the phone). Caregiving in the U.S. 2015 finds that, among a nationally representative sample of caregivers of adults, 22% provide care to someone with Alzheimer’s or dementia. This paper examines the responses of 372 dementia caregivers and 963 non-dementia 4 In order to qualify for this study, caregivers had to self-identify as providing unpaid care to a family member or friend in the 12 months leading up to the time of survey; those who were paid in some way to provide care were ineligible to complete this study. 5 Dementia caregivers include two groups: (1) those who indicated their care recipient’s main problem for which he or she needed care was Alzheimer’s disease or dementia; and (2) those who indicated their care recipient had Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or other mental confusion but it was not the main caregiving issue. 6 To see complete study results, questionnaires, or detailed study methodology, please see Caregiving in the U.S. 2015 full report and Appendices A and B. 7 caregivers.7,8 For more information about the prevalence of dementia caregiving, the samples used for this paper, and weighting strategies, please see Detailed Methodology (page 38). Reading This Report All demographic information about caregivers refers to their current situations if currently caregiving, or to when they last provided care if not currently serving as a caregiver (but served in the past 12 months). All figures have been weighted and rounded.' metadata={'url': 'https://www.caregiving.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Dementia-Caregiving-in-the-US_February-2017.pdf', 'chunk_id': 6, '_id': '54d20afa-a708-4e6b-9e4e-adcce3d8f308', '_collection_name': 'DementiaCare_Semantic'}\n",
      "page_content='22 The pattern is similar for physical strain: as dementia caregivers report increasing levels of physical strain, they become more likely to report worsening health—such that among those who report high physical strain (5 out of 5), three out of four report caregiving has worsened their health (76 percent). Figure 20: Negative Health Impacts of Caregiving by Physical Strain Percent reporting worse health as a result of caregiving Overall, this suggests that dementia caregivers’ greater likelihood to experience worsening health could be at least partially attributed to the more difficult emotional and physical requirements of their caregiving duties.
