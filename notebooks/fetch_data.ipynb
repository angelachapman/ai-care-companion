      "page_content='Alcohol Use Alcohol may act differently in older adults than in younger people. Some older adults can feel “high” without increasing the amount of alcohol they drink. This can make them more likely to be confused or have accidents, including falls, broken bones, and car crashes, which can cause head injuries among other problems. If people choose to drink alcohol, U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans say that moderate drinking is up to two drinks a day for men, and one for women. Some people should not drink alcohol. Many older adults should be extra careful because they often take medicines that can interact with it. For example:  Alcohol and over-the-counter cough and cold remedies together can cause drowsiness and potential accidental overdoses. Older people are at even greater risk for these side effects.  Using alcohol with common blood pressure medicines can increase risk for dizziness, drowsiness, and changes in heartbeat. Talk with your health care provider if you have concerns or questions about alcohol and your health. You can also consult these websites for more information about alcohol in general and its effects as we age.

      "Alzheimer’s Disease Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, or loss of certain brain functions, among older adults. Memory loss is usually its first sign. Early signs of Alzheimer’s disease are:  Finding it hard to remember things  Asking the same questions over and over  Having trouble paying bills or solving simple math problems  Getting lost  Losing things or putting them in odd places Later signs of Alzheimer’s disease:  Forgetting how to brush teeth or comb hair  Being confused about time, people, or places  Forgetting names of common things, such as a desk, house, or apple  Wandering away from home No one knows how to prevent Alzheimer’s disease. There are no pills, foods, or brain games that have been proven to prevent dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease.

      "Dementia People with dementia have significant problems in cognitive function – the ability to think, remember, or reason – that interferes with normal activities and relationships. They may also lose their ability to solve problems and control their emotions, and sometimes may have personality changes and behavioral problems. Dementia is not a disease, but the general term for these symptoms. The diseases that can cause dementia are Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington’s disease, and other conditions. Some medicines to treat dementia like Alzheimer’s disease can delay symptoms for a period of time. Certain types of dementia can be reversed with appropriate treatment. Depending on the type of dementia, other approaches, like computerized recall devices or note taking, may help. No brain game or other specific type of mental activity has been proven directly to prevent or slow the development of dementia. However, keeping the mind active through a variety of activities has been linked to a reduced risk of dementia.
