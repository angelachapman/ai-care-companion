What impact does caregiving for dementia patients have on the emotional and physical health of caregivers?,"['2 Considering all of the responsibilities that dementia caregivers often shoulder, it is of no surprise that the Burden of Care Index2 shows them as one of the more burdened groups of caregivers. Nearly half of dementia caregivers are in a high-burden situation. Dementia caregivers are not the most-burdened group—for example, cancer caregivers are more likely to be in high-burden care relationships (62 percent).3 However, whereas cancer caregiver relationships are short and episodic, dementia caregiver relationships tend to be longer: nearly seven in ten (69 percent) dementia caregivers have provided care for more than a year, and three in ten have provided care for more than five years. This high burden of care over a longer period can take a significant mental and physical toll on dementia caregivers. Nearly half of dementia caregivers say providing care is emotionally stressful, and three in ten say that providing care often involves physical strain. Ultimately, this physical and emotional stress appears to have a negative impact on the health of many dementia caregivers. About four in ten (42 percent) say their health is “excellent” or “very good”—statistically significantly lower than the share among non-dementia caregivers (50 percent). Alarmingly, dementia caregivers are nearly twice as likely to say that their health has gotten worse as a result of their caregiving responsibilities. More than one in three dementia caregivers says their health has declined (35 percent), versus just one in five non-dementia caregivers. Many dementia caregivers report that they receive help. Dementia caregivers, more than non-dementia caregivers, are often one part of a larger care team, and they receive more paid and unpaid assistance than non-dementia caregivers. Four in ten dementia caregivers are the sole unpaid caregiver for their loved one. Nearly half of dementia caregivers say their loved one has received help from aides, housekeepers, or other paid help (45 percent), including 43 percent of sole unpaid dementia caregivers. More than one in four has used a respite service (27 percent). However, not all dementia caregivers can find resources when they need them: 28 percent say they find it difficult to get affordable services in their loved one’s community. Six in ten dementia caregivers were employed in the last year while they provided care to their loved one. Employed dementia caregivers work an average of 34.9 hours per week while caregiving, and more than half (57 percent) work full time. Seven in ten employed dementia caregivers (70 percent) say their supervisor was aware of their caregiving situation. Nonetheless, many employed caregivers struggle to balance their job and their caregiving responsibilities. Two in three employed dementia caregivers report that their caregiving responsibilities affected their work in some way (statistically significantly higher than the 59 percent of non-dementia caregivers). 2 “Burden of Care” is an index that']","Caregiving for dementia patients has a significant negative impact on the emotional and physical health of caregivers.

What is the purpose of counselling for individuals who have recently been diagnosed with dementia?,"['they are unlikely to help if a person is in the later stage. this is because the person may have problems with their attention, communication, understanding and memory, which are all key to being able to benefit from talking therapies. however, there are other ways to support people in the later stage of dementia, such as through sensitive listening or sensory stimulation. talking therapies can give a person with dementia the chance to speak openly about their feelings, including how they feel about a recent diagnosis. this can help them adjust and live with their condition more successfully. they might find it helpful to discuss problems with a therapist rather than their friends or family members. a therapist can give the person a safe space to explore the reasons why they feel how they do and ways to support them. this can be comforting. it can also help them maintain healthy relationships with their friends and family members. there is evidence that having talking therapy over several weeks may reduce depression and anxiety in people in the early stage of dementia. it is important that the therapy is adapted to the person’s level of communication, understanding and memory. it’s therefore likely to be most effective if the therapist has experience of working with people with dementia and a good understanding of the condition. suitable talking therapies are not always available in the person’s local area. people in care homes may find it particularly difficult to access talking therapy services. types of talking therapy there are many different types of talking therapy. the main ones are explained below. the most suitable type will depend on: the difficulties the person is facing what the person wants to get out of therapy the type and stage of their dementia the symptoms they are having their personality and feelings about therapy. expand all collapse all counselling counselling is the general term for a range of talking therapies, including individual, group and couples sessions. it aims to help a person better understand their problems and then explore ways to manage them. a counsellor should not give the person ‘answers’. they will give them time to think about their problems with the guidance of a professional. counselling is often used to help a person cope with events they’ve found difficult. it can be particularly helpful for people who have recently been diagnosed with dementia. the process of being assessed for suspected dementia can also be confusing, stressful and make the person feel anxious. many people with dementia struggle to make sense of their diagnosis and how their life is changing. they may feel lost, confused, vulnerable or anxious. counselling can help them manage these worries, such as feeling less depressed, more hopeful and accepting of their diagnosis. psychotherapy psychotherapy is a term for another range of talking therapies. the type of psychotherapy that a person is offered will depend on what is most']","The purpose of counselling for individuals who have recently been diagnosed with dementia is to help them better understand their problems and explore ways to manage them.
